# IT WORKED SOMEHOW

Well the last time I have edited this readme It wasnt that great, now's different.

### So ToDos

- [ ] how the fucks does this work
- [ ] Add relations in the script with to the payments database
- [ ] Make the script make a relation and add it to the first payment view or the secon payment view. this depends if the entrance day is after or before 15 day of month
- [ ] When reaches the next month, create two new views of **that** month first and second payment
- [ ] When it reaches the 5th month of the day, hide the view of the previous month just to make things cleaner in the Notion Home (do this with a conditional maybe on another module)
