# IT WORKED SOMEHOW

Well the last time I have edited this readme It wasnt that great, now's different.

### So ToDos

- [x] how the fucks does this work
- [x] Add relations in the script with to the payments database
- [x] Make the script make a relation and add it to the first payment view or the secon payment view. this depends if the entrance day is after or before 15 day of month
- [ ] ~~When reaches the next month, create two new views of **that** month first and second payment~~
- [ ] ~~When it reaches the 5th month of the day, hide the view of the previous month just to make things cleaner in the Notion Home (do this with a conditional maybe on another module)~~
- [x] Make a script that checks if the current page is on the current month or not. If not procede to update and delete the relation property.
- [x] Make the above happen when the main scripts is executed in half or more days in the month
- [ ] Create a property that will have the amount of money that I will gain in that shift (including bonuses, licenses, holidays and all that shit)
- [ ] Make a module that calculates the payment days, 5 working days afther 15 day of the month and the last day (maybe with a dict that has the chilean holidays to avoid counting that days)
- [x] Add colours if the shift is opening, middle, closing or nocturnal (opening = 07:00am to 18:30pm, middle 11:30am to 22:00pm, closing 15:30 to 01:00am and nocturnal 20:30pm to 07:00am)
- [ ] When the pay script is done, add that day to the calendar with the aproximate payment amount (maybe with a relation property?)
